# 🔄 React Class Components vs Hooks - Side by Side Comparison

This project is a comprehensive **React practice playground** that demonstrates how class components and functional components with hooks handle the **same functionality**. It's an excellent way to understand how React hooks (introduced in React 16.8) can simplify your code and enable functional programming paradigms.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is divided into two major parts:

- `classComponent/`: Contains all examples implemented using **Class Components**
- `hooksComponent/`: Contains all examples implemented using **React Hooks**

Each pair of components is named and numbered correspondingly for easier comparison.

## 📘 Learning Outcome

This project will help you:

- Transition from class-based React to functional hooks-based development
- Understand how lifecycle methods translate into `useEffect`
- Write cleaner and more reusable logic using hooks
- Develop an intuition for advanced concepts like `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, and custom hooks
